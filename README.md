# About

As a part of my Applied Statistics course (STAT 4052), a partner and I we're tasked with completing a project centered around statistical analysis of diabatic patients. In doing so, we implemented an Iterative Regression model, along with various classification models including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression.

This repository includes our statistical analysis conducted in R Studio, the diabetic status dataset, and our written report.

Below is the introduction for our written report to give you a better idea of what to expect from this project. Thanks!

## Introduction

Our STAT 4052 final project tasked us with analyzing a dataset containing medical and demographic information of 5000 medical patients. Each patient was given a diagnosis of diabetic status, either negative or positive. Our goal was to conduct statistical analysis on our diabetes dataset considering two objectives: one, to determine the most important variables in predicting diabetic status, and two, creating a statistical model to help predict the diabetic status of future patients. In doing so, we employed several statistical methods that were carefully chosen given the distribution and assumptions of our dataset. Our analysis determined variables HbA1c Levels and Blood Glucose Levels were the most statistically significant variables in predicting diabetes, and thus should be strongly considered when analyzing the diabetic status of future medical patients.
